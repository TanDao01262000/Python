* Begin with a normal character - with just hand 
* Choosing the particular story for the each class to get the weapons: long swords, magic books, bows and arrows, axes, ... 
* Multiple sorts of characters: knight, sorcerer, archer, warrior, ....
* Unique skill for each class beside the normal movements: jump, bow down, sprint, move left, right, up, and down.
* Dungeons: where to get special weapons, no need a such power to defeat the boss, need more work on brain
* No level system 
* Each class has a different story and way to get or enhance skills
* The main story is still the same
